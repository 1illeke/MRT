# Marvel Rivals Tracker 🕷️

> **TL;DR**: Didnt like TRN tracker bc of ads. Got a sidequest, had a breakdown, bon-appetit.

## What It Does

It's pretty basic:

- **Player Stats**: See your overall, ranked, and unranked performance
- **Match History**: Browse through your recent games (up to 500 matches (api limitations))
- **Random Stats**: Some random stats that I wanted for some reason.
- **Match Details**: Match info (some stuff broken)
- **Search**: Find specific matches/players by ID

## Tech Stack

- **React** - Because I know it and it works
- **React Router** - For navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** - Made it look decent without crying
- **Marvel Rivals API** - The real MVP here


## Current State

This is definitely an **MVP**. It works, it's useful, but there's still a ton of stuff I want to add:

- [ ] Better hero statistics breakdown
- [ ] Match filtering and advanced search  
- [ ] Performance trends and graphs
- [ ] Compare players feature
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle (it's just dark for now)
- [ ] Mobile app maybe? (just added this to populate the readme, but no, not gonna happen)

## API Credits

Huge shoutout to [Marvel Rivals API](https://marvelrivalsapi.com/) for making this possible. Without them, this would just be a very pretty loading screen.
